I began designing for BSR in Spring 2023 before becoming their Art Director. Alongside making scientific graphics, illustrations, and data visualizations, I lead a team of 8-15 designers through each publication cycle by running weekly meetings; providing guidance, resources, critiques, and feedback; managing our workplan and deadlines; assembling the final magazine; copy-editing; managing design style guides; and coordinating with the rest of the executive team to make sure everything is running smoothly. We are currently working on Issue 50!
